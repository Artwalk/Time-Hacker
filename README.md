I read many books about how to make full use of time.  

In the process, little by little, I realised that **TIME** are really your *friends* rather than enemies.  

You playing with it, working with it, living with it.  

As a person, You can using past experiences as a base for further improvement.  
So, something like a  *time tracker* would be needed.

In the past two years, I found a lot of softwares such as *idoit Any.do Catch*, which help me a lot.
  
But there was a problem, *time tracker* is something I need to use at least several decades(considering my health). If I use an app, how on earth do I know this app's lifecycle(Catch had already been ceased, all the data I recorded was gone).

The only thing I can see is *Google Calendar*. although they closed *Google's reader*, *Google Calendar* is the best *time tracker* I have ever seen.

But, it's just a tracker, not a hacker.

Here are some ways I'm thinking about:

1. Insert [Pomodoro](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pomodoro-Technique-Francesco-Cirillo/dp/1445219948/ref=pd_sim_b_3) into *Google Calendar*

1. Analyse all the Event, and generate a chart
